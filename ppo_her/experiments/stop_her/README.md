# Stop HER

Change to ME HER after 100,000 timesteps to fix convergence problems.  This is not used in [Maximum Entropy HER (MEHER)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24016), but it is similar to the Red line in Figures 6 and 7, except that the red line was generated when we reach a reward (not time) threshold.
